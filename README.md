# Usage

Gradle:

Step 1. Add the JitPack repository to your build file

Add it in your root build.gradle at the end of repositories:

```gradle 
allprojects {
	repositories {
		     maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
	}
}
```
  
Step 2. Add the dependency [ make sure that you are on the latest release number ]

```gradle
dependencies {
	        implementation 'com.github.district0:ZoomX:1.0.4'
}
```
  
Step 3. Initiate ZoomX service
```java
        ZoomX.init(new Config.Builder(this).build());
```
Step 4. Log your network requests 
        
# Retrofit
Just add Zoomx NetworkLogInterceptor:
```java	  
	  OkHttpClient.Builder httpClient = new OkHttpClient
                .Builder()
                .addInterceptor(new NetworkLogInterceptor(this.context));
```

# Volley or any request method 

Just create zoomx request entitiy object then send it to zoomx network log manager. 
	  
For example: 
	
```java
	RequestEntity.Builder requestBuilder = new RequestEntity.Builder();

        requestBuilder.setMethod("GET")
                .setCode(200)
                .setStartDate("Start-Date")
                .setUrl("https://github.com/district0/ZoomX")
                .setRequestBody("JSON_BODY")
                .setRequestHeaders("HEADERS")
		.setResponseBody(response);

        NetworkLogManager.log(requestBuilder);
```
